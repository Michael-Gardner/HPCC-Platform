#  LIBMEMCACHED_FOUND - system has the libmemcached library
#  LIBMEMCACHED_INCLUDE_DIR - the libmemcached include directory(s)
#  LIBMEMCACHED_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use libmemcached

#  If the memcached libraries are found on the system, we assume they exist natively and dependencies
